Project Specification: Car Sound Detector

Summary
The Car Sound Detector is a mobile diagnostic tool that leverages machine learning and audio signal processing to identify potential vehicle mechanical failures. By analyzing user-recorded sounds against a library of known fault signatures, the application can distinguish between benign noises and critical issues like belt slippage, rod knock, or brake grinding. This system empowers drivers with immediate, actionable insights, bridging the gap between noticing a strange noise and visiting a professional mechanic.

Key Features
- AI-Powered Acoustic Diagnosis: Uses spectral analysis to match recorded audio patterns with a database of specific mechanical malfunctions.
- Noise Isolation Algorithm: Automatically filters out wind, traffic, and cabin conversation to isolate the target engine or chassis sound.
- Severity Indicator: Provides a "Traffic Light" urgency rating (Green/Yellow/Red) advising the user if the car is safe to drive or requires immediate towing.
- Repair Cost Estimator: Offers a rough price range for the diagnosed issue and connects users with top-rated local repair shops.

Target Users
The primary audience includes non-technical car owners seeking peace of mind, DIY enthusiasts looking for diagnostic confirmation, and used car buyers needing to vet a vehicle’s condition during a test drive.

Core User Flows
The user opens the app and selects the general origin of the sound (e.g., Engine Bay, Wheels/Brakes, Undocarriage). Upon tapping "Analyze," the user records the sound for 10-15 seconds. The app processes the audio clip, displays the most likely malfunction with a confidence percentage, and presents a "Next Steps" screen where the user can choose to save the report or locate a nearby mechanic.
